# Projects

This is an online repository of some of the projects that I have undergone, while self-teaching Python.
All of the code is written in Python 3.

The more simple code is under 'First attempts' and 'Number'. I then decided to try to implement some classic graph theory algorithms, alongside a graph theory course I was studying at university.

Most recently I have been creating card games. For example, when Blackjack is run, it allows the user to play blackjack against the dealer, and keep track of their stack.
